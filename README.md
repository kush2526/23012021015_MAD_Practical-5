AIM: Create an Android Application that includes Login and Registration screens using Jetpack Compose.
Describe: This project aims to demonstrate how to design and implement user authentication screens using Jetpack Compose, the modern UI toolkit for Android. The application provides two main features:
A Login screen where existing users can enter their credentials (email and password) to access the app.
A Registration screen that allows new users to create an account by entering details such as name, email, and password.
Navigation between both screens is handled using the Navigation Component in Compose. The project focuses on UI design, input validation, state management, and maintaining a smooth user experience without using traditional XML layouts.
